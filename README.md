# Beacon <img src="https://github.com/ColdCoffee21/Beacon/blob/master/images/beacon_icon.png" alt="" width="30" height="30">
A flutter application that is able to share your location with anyone who has a specific passkey. For example, suppose you are going to start a hike with friends and you want them to know your location but only for the next 3 hours. This can be done in many ways, but let's say one is by letting them know your passkey.


There are two modes of operation: Someone is sharing their location (i.e, “carrying the beacon”) and everybody else can see that location (they are “following the beacon”).
